  4.  stir until everything is dissolved

_Note 1: food grade citric acid can be purchased for cheap online_
  
_Note 2: heating up strawberries substantially affects the flavor, and care should be taken to avoid it_

_Note 3: This variety of Phat Tea should be consumed immediately. The fresh strawberry flavor begins to degrade in hours,
and within about a day, it tastes the same as if it got cooked._
